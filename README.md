# üì° PtyINR: Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation

**PtyINR** is a deep learning framework for joint reconstruction of complex-valued **objects** and **illumination probes** in X-ray ptychography. It leverages **implicit neural representations** and **physics-informed optimization** to enable high-quality reconstructions under challenging conditions such as **low-dose measurements**, **noisy data**, and **limited overlap**. This repository provides the main scripts, utilities, and interactive notebooks to run PtyINR on both **simulated** and **real experimental datasets**.
